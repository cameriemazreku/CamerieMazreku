## About Me

Back in 2021, I began my journey into software engineering with a strong interest in operating systems and blockchain. Fast forward to today, I’ve had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects, including decentralized applications, AI assistants, and kernel development.

My primary focus these days is enhancing cloud database performance and automating complex systems at Columbia University. I also enjoy working on side projects like Rhea AI, an assistant that helps students build job-relevant projects.

When I’m not coding, I love exploring new technologies, mentoring students, and diving into the latest advancements in AI and machine learning.
